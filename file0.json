How to do it:\xa0Stand in the classic mountain pose (Tadasana)          with your arms at your sides, your big toes touching each other          and your heels slightly spread apart. Raise your arms and          interlace your fingers over your head with your index fingers          pointing upwards. Draw an invisible arch with your arms, extending          them to your side as far as you can while pushing your hip in the          opposite direction. Make sure you keep your arms straight. Move          your arms back to center and stretch to the other direction,          holding the pose at maximum range for 30-60 seconds at a time. You          can also try doing this pose while seated (the sitting side          stretch).'''], 'image': '../../../media/images/Yoga/StandingSideStretch.png'},{'heading': 'Bound Angle Pose', 'paragraphs': ['''Target areas:\xa0hips, thighs and knees.          Benefits:\xa0Opens hips and thighs wider for easier childbirth, eases knee pain, helps with sore or swollen feet and reduces overall body fatigue.          How to do it:\xa0Sit on the floor with your legs stretched straight in front of you. Bend your knees and pull your heels closer to your pelvis. Drop your knees sideways as far as they can get. Don�t force them all the way down if your hips are tight. Just try to relax your thighs and hips as much as you can.          With your thighs to the sides and the soles of your feet pressing against each other, try to pull in your heels as much as you can. Then grasp the big toe or ankle of each foot with your hands.          Hold this pose for 1-5 minutes. Repeat it regularly if your hips and groin feel tight. It will improve flexibility and open up your hips.'''], 'image': '../../../media/images/Yoga/Bound Angle Pose.png'},{'heading': 'Yoga Squat', 'paragraphs': ['''Target areas:\xa0belly, hips and pelvis.          Benefits:\xa0This is one of the best poses if your hips are feeling too tight. It also helps to widen the pelvis which makes childbirth easier.          How to do it:\xa0Sit on the floor with your legs spread out in front of you. Bend your knees upwards one at a time, bringing your foot as close to your butt as possible. The knees should be slightly wider than your shoulder width.          Slowly lift off your butt, putting weight onto your feet and hold that lifted pose for several seconds.          If this feels too strenuous you can also try a supported yoga squat where you sit on a low stool or block.'''], 'image': '../../../media/images/Yoga/Yoga Squat.png'},{'heading': 'Easy Pose (Sukhasana)', 'paragraphs': ['''Target areas:\xa0back and hips.          Benefits:\xa0This is more of a meditation pose. It calms the mind and helps fight stress and anxiety. It�s also great for opening up the hips and reducing lower back pain.          How to do it:\xa0Sit on a yoga mat and cross your shins. The soles of your feet should be facing outwards under the opposite leg. Your legs should form a triangle with your crossed shins forming a sort of a straight line.          You can lay your hands on your knees with the palms facing up or down. If you feel uncomfortable, fold a blanket and sit on it.          Hold this pose for as long as you feel comfortable then cross your shins the other way and hold again.          Feel free to try some relaxing meditation.'''], 'image': '../../../media/images/Yoga/Easy Pose.png'},{'heading': 'Important Breathing Tips', 'paragraphs': ['''The most important element in postpartum yoga is\xa0your breathing. Something that separates yoga from other kinds of exercise is the fact that each posture is linked to inhale and exhale. Why so much heavy breathing?          Breathing and moving together sets the pace of your practice. It also helps you move more deeply into postures, says Larson. Deep breathing�long, full inhales and exhales�also brings oxygen to the entire body, which energizes your system. Here are the basics of yoga breathing:          Inhale\xa0through your nose; fill your belly, ribs, and upper chest with air so that they puff out in front of you.          Exhale\xa0through your nose and tuck in your belly button as the air is being released.'''], 'image': '../../../media/images/Yoga/Important Breathing Tips.png'}
