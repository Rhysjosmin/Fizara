      <p style="font-size: 1em">
        <b>Consuming Whole Foods</b>  – Whole foods do not contain artificial
        sugars and are free from preservatives. Some of the whole foods that can
        be added to women’s diet with PCOD are fruits, vegetables, whole grains
        and legumes. These may help to maintain the insulin levels, and thus
        PCOD can be kept in control. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b
          >Watching out for Carbohydrate intake</b
        > – Carbohydrates can impact the blood sugar level resulting in high
        insulin levels. It is important to consume only less carbohydrate and
        have more high protein and high fibre foods . 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b
          >Adding anti-inflammatory foods</b
        >
        – PCOS can be considered as a  chronic inflammatory condition. Hence,
        eating foods that are anti-inflammatory in nature helps to reduce the
        symptoms accompanied by PCOS. Foods like tomatoes, leafy veggies and
        greens, fatty fish like mackerel and tuna, tree nuts and olive oil
        possess anti-inflammatory properties.   <br /> <br /><b
          >Keeping the iron intake high</b
        > – Due to excess bleeding than usual during menstrual cycles in women
        with PCOS, there are more likely chances to have iron deficiency. This
        may make the woman suffering from PCOS become anemic. Adding iron rich
        foods in the diet can help avoid this problem. Foods such as spinach,
        eggs , liver and broccoli are the best iron rich foods to be included.
        It is also equally important to consult the doctor on iron supplements
        and consumption of iron rich foods. <br /> <br /><b
          >Increasing the intake of magnesium</b
        > – Magnesium-rich foods such as cashews, almonds, bananas, spinach can
        be added to the diet to fight PCOS symptoms. Magnesium helps to maintain
        the insulin levels and helps in restful sleep.
     <br>
     <br>

        <b>In-take of fiber</b> – Adding fiber to the diet helps with digestion. Foods like lentils, lima beans, broccoli, brussels sprouts, pears, and avocados are rich in fiber and help to improve  digestion for women with PCOS, as they may suffer from bloating and constipation during their menstrual cycles. 
        <br>  <br><b>Avoiding coffee</b> –  Caffeine in coffee stimulates the body by increasing estrogen levels. As a result, a hormonal imbalance may happen. It is advisable to avoid coffee. Instead, the individual can consume herbal tea for refreshment. Green tea also helps maintain insulin levels and acts as an agent for weight reduction, which is crucial for women with PCOS.
        <br>  <br><b>Consuming Soy products </b>– Including soy protein or soy products in the diet helps in balancing the estrogen in the body, and hence, the normal secretion of hormones can be maintained. Foods like soy milk, tofu, miso, and tempeh can be considered. However, people with any estrogen-related problems like breast cancer are advised not to consume soy products. Hence, it is necessary to check with the doctor before including soy in the diet.
        <br>  <br><b>Avoiding junk and oily/fatty foods</b> – Oily foods add to weight gain and abnormal functioning of the digestive system. This can cause severe symptoms of PCOS. Hence, it is essential to avoid junk and oily foods completely, although olive oil is an exception.
        <br>  <br><b>Balancing exercises</b> – To maintain a healthy lifestyle, it is necessary to exercise and keep the body healthy and fit. Exercising at least 150 minutes per week helps to reduce stress and balances the weight. Also, the calories are constantly burnt and hence, insulin levels can be kept under control.
