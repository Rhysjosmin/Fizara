          <div>
            <h1>Plank Vinyasa</h1>
            <p>
              Get down on all fours with your wrists under your shoulders. Place
              a folded blanket under your wrists if you need support, or lower
              onto your forearms. To get into Plank position, straighten one leg
              at a time behind you, balancing on the balls of your feet, abs
              pulled up and in, and head in line with your spine (i.e., neither
              straining up nor hanging down). Elongate your spine and press into
              the balls of your feet. Inhale, then exhale as you draw your right
              knee in toward your chest, contracting the muscles in your lower
              belly (shown). Return to Plank position, then switch legs.
              Alternate knee tucks for 8 to 20 reps. Benefits: Increases stamina
              and strength, especially in your deep abdominal and back muscles.

          <img src="../../../media/images/Yoga/Loctus Pose.png" alt="" />
          <div>
            <h1>Loctus Pose</h1>
            <p>
              Lie flat on your belly with your legs hipwidth apart on the floor.
              Rest your head on your hands (A). Clasp your hands behind your
              lower back to open through your chest and shoulders. Keep your
              spine long and squeeze your buttocks, pressing your hips into the
              floor as you lift your head, shoulders and legs off the mat,
              keeping your neck in line with your spine. As you lift your legs
              up and out, tuck your tailbone under and keep your belly
              contracted and pulled away from the floor (B). Hold for 3 to 5
              breaths, then lower to starting position. Repeat for 2 to 3 reps.
              Benefits: Strengthens the deep back muscles of the core and opens
              your chest and shoulders, improving posture and relieving
              lower-back and upper-body strain.

          <div>
            <h1>Pelvic Tilts</h1>
            <p>
              For this gentle postpartum yoga position, lie on your back with
              feet hip-width apart, your arms straight at your sides and palms
              down. Curl your tailbone under slightly, feeling your spine settle
              into the floor, which relieves pressure in the low back. Inhale,
              then exhale as you lift your hips up slowly, tilting your pelvis
              as you tuck your tailbone under and scoop your lower belly in
              (shown). Hold for 1 to 2 breaths, then lower to starting position.
              Repeat for 5 to 10 reps. Benefits: Strengthens the upper and lower
              back, hips and legs. Brings awareness and strength to the pelvic
              floor and lower belly.

          <div>
            <h1>Legs Wide Pose</h1>
            <p>
              Lie on your back and lift your legs so your body forms a letter
              "L." Lace your hands behind your head as you squeeze your ab
              muscles. Exhale as you lift your shoulders off the floor. Separate
              your legs a few inches, reaching one arm forward and between your
              legs. Contract your lower belly as you reach (shown). Keep your
              upper body lifted as you bring your legs together and place your
              hands back behind your head. Switch sides and repeat for 8 to 10
              reps. Benefits: Strengthens the deep abdominal muscles and
              stretches the hamstrings.
