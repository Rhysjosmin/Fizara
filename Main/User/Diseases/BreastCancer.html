            <h1>Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana)</h1>

            <ul>
              <li>
                FIRST SEQUENCE This sequence are for those who have been into
                yoga earlier, and have crossed the treatment stages with Breast
                Cancer, but want to keep their body muscles strong and flexible.
                Here the poses will help them get back to life with confidence
                and strength.
              </li>
              <li>
                Come to sit at the centre of the mat in Baddha Konasana, where
                the soles of the feet are placed touching at the toes and the
                heels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Taking a few breaths here, slowly connect the movement of the
                body with the breathing. Calm your thoughts, your inner stress,
                your limbs and your facial muscles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Holding the feet in your hands, exhale and push the thighs
                downwards moving them closer to the floor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Seated here in Bound Angle Pose, the hips open, while flexing
                the thighs and the extension of the spine encourages the flow of
                prana upwards and downwards.
              </li>
              <li>
                For a more dynamic way, flap the thighs fast in Butterfly
                movement to encourage deeper opening of the hips and the lower
                back.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stay here for almost 12 breaths. Understand the body while
                flapping and stop when not feeling good.
              </li>
              <li>
                Placing a cushion below the hips for better support will bring
                less strain on the spine and the flow of prana would be smooth
                and you could sit longer too.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Diaphragmatic Breathing</h1>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Release from Baddha Konasana, hoping the hips and the thighs are
                ready for the next poses.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cross the legs in Simple pose or Sukhasana. Bring the Right Foot
                in first and then the Left Foot over the right to be seated
                crossed leg.
              </li>
              <li>
                Placing the left hand on the belly, close to the navel and the
                right hand on the chest, palms facing inwards, close your eyes
                and sit extending the spine.
              </li>
              <li>
                This kind of breathing called the THREE PART breath, actively
                uses the abdomen, the belly, the lower part of the chest and the
                lower part of the throat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inhale and fill air into the belly, slowly moving upwards to the
                lower part of the chest and then finally the throat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Exhale and release from the throat first, the chest and finally
                the belly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Repeat this process of breathing, keeping the breath slow and
                steady, while using the palms of the hands to feel and connect
                with the movement of the body.
              </li>
              <li>
                The breathing should be continuous, inhaled and exhaled through
                the nose only. Watch for the expansion of the lungs, the chest,
                the abdomen.
              </li>
              <li>
                This kind of breathing, Dirga Pranayama is nourishing, calming
                and relaxing. It helps one to connect with the inner self using
                the hands to also feel the movement of the body along with the
                breath.

                From the Three Part Breathing, relax and come to sit on your
                knees.
              </li>
              <li>
                Exhale and place the palms on the floor in front of you, making
                sure they are in line with your knee and the thighs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keeping a comfortable distance between the knees and the palms,
                make sure the alignment of the body is perfect while on all
                fours.
              </li>
              <li>
                Knees under the hips, palms under the shoulders, inhale and
                bring the chest outwards, belly towards the ground, shoulders
                backwards, gaze up, curve the back inwards.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the exhale, round the spine, tuck the tailbone, pull the
                belly in towards the spine, round the shoulders, bring the chin
                to lock and look down.
              </li>
              <li>
                Repeat this breathing while moving the spine at your own pace,
                focusing on the breath.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cat Cow Pose brings awareness of the spine, opens the chest and
                allows the practitioner to feel confident and yet grounded and
                soft.
              </li>
              <li>
                This pose can be done seated on the floor or on the chair if the
                arms cannot take the weight of the body.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do this for about 8 rounds of both inhaling and exhaling and go
                at your own pace.

            <ul>

                To move from Cat Cow pose and to go a till deeper with the
                stretch and the strength, practice Balancing Table Pose.
              </li>
              <li>
                From Cat Cow pose, release to come to neutral. Inhale and extend
                the right arm out, while slowly adjusting to extend the left leg
                out behind you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stay extending the alternative arm and leg in Balancing Table
                Pose or Dandayamana Bharmanasana. Be here for about 2 breaths
                and release.
              </li>
              <li>
                Come to the first position, and relax taking few breaths, and if
                required you could rest in Vajrasana too.
              </li>
              <li>
                Come back to Cow pose, inhale and extend the left arm in front
                of you and slowly bring the right leg out extending behind you.
              </li>
              <li>
                This pose helps to improve the core muscles, improves balance
                while strengthening the shoulders and the chest.
              </li>
              <li>
                Go steady while understanding the body and it limitations. The
                shoulders and the arms need to regain strength slowly, with all
                the wear and tear of the muscles that were exhausted with the
                treatment of Breast Cancer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Repeat this pose couple of times more taking complete rest in
                between in Vajrasana. Using the wall for support should be
                AVOIDED here, as one does not want to fight against gravity.
                Being natural with the body along with gravity is better in this
                situation.

                One of the elements, as described in Yoga, THE EARTH ELEMENT, is
                considered solid and represents the bones, flesh, skin, tissues
                and hair in the human anatomy.
              </li>
              <li>
                This element reflects stability and strength even under stress
                and is connected to the Root Chakra.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hence these standing poses, starting from Tadasana, helps to
