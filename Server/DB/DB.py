The study found that people who drank two to three cups of coffee per day had a 20% lower risk of heart disease compared to those who did not drink coffee. The researchers believe that the antioxidants and other beneficial compounds in coffee may be responsible for this protective effect.",

The fish, which has been named the 'Black-Blotched Stingray', was found at a depth of over 2,000 meters and has unique features such as its black and white coloration and a spine that is used for defense. The discovery is an exciting development for marine biology and highlights the need to continue exploring the depths of the ocean.",

        "Body": "Researchers have discovered a potential new treatment for type 2 diabetes. The treatment involves a drug that targets a specific protein in the liver, which has been found to play a key role in regulating blood sugar levels. In tests on mice, the drug was able to significantly lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Further research is needed to determine whether the drug is safe and effective in humans, but the findings offer hope for those living with type 2 diabetes.",

The study followed over 1,000 teenagers for two years and found that those who spent more than four hours per day on screens were significantly more likely to develop symptoms of depression compared to those who spent less time on screens. The researchers suggest that this link may be due to the social isolation and lack of physical activity that often accompanies excessive screen time.",
